			<h1>RC Day 0: Welcome, Meeting, Panels, and Presentations</h1>

<p>First day of RC highlights included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whirlwind meet-and-greet, where the most common question was &ldquo;so what are you working on?&rdquo; for current folks and &ldquo;what do you want to work on&rdquo; for new folks</li>
<li>A discussion of &ldquo;what are you excited about&rdquo; and &ldquo;what are you nervous about&rdquo;:</li>
</ul>

<div class='image'><a href='/uploads/2017/8/14/2017-08-14_18.35.42.jpg'><img src='/uploads/2017/8/14/2017-08-14_18.35.42-640x480.jpg' class='uploaded-img' /></a></div>

<ul>
<li><p>Panels about self-direction, choosing and scoping projects, and common struggles and how to cope with them. Oneof the stand-out aspects of RC is the strong focus on well-being, empathy, and kindness in addition to the programming/technical stuff. Definitely something that&rsquo;s missing in a lot of other technical spaces.</p></li>

<li><p>A skit about the RC <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment">social rules</a> &ndash; much better than that sounds:</p></li>
</ul>

<div class='image'><a href='/uploads/2017/8/14/2017-08-14_17.29.48.jpg'><img src='/uploads/2017/8/14/2017-08-14_17.29.48-640x480.jpg' class='uploaded-img' /></a></div>

<ul>
<li>Presentations! I gave a presentation based on my <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/11/so-you-want-to-secure-something.html">So You Want To Secure Something</a> Akamai blog post. In retrospect, it was too much content to fit into five minutes, especially without slides. Hopefully I succeeded in conveying my key message: security doesn&rsquo;t have to be scary, it <em>is</em> something every Recurser can learn, and learning doesn&rsquo;t have to be a painful process.</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent the break time researching a better way to pair people up for the meet-and-greet, in the process learning about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">assignment problem</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_roommates_problem">stable roommate problem</a> &ndash; a variant of the stable marriage problem I learned about in discrete math.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the first &ldquo;real day&rdquo; of RC. I think I&rsquo;m going to push myself to pair with folks &ndash; possibly putting up a sign saying what I&rsquo;d like help with. There are a lot of folks here experienced in frontend dev/data presentation as well as folks who&rsquo;ve been learning Rust, two areas I could definitely start out in.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;m super happy and excited for what the next twelve weeks will bring. Onward!</p>
