<p>Tomorrow begins my 12-week stint at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, hereafter &ldquo;RC&rdquo; :)</p>

<p>In the spirit of SMART goals, here are some specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely goals I&rsquo;ll grade myself on at the end of RC.</p>

<h3 id="pair-with-people-and-build-great-relationships">Pair with people and build great relationships</h3>

<p>RC&rsquo;s guide mentions that &ldquo;I wish I had paired more&rdquo; is one of the most frequent pieces of feedback from alumni &ndash; even when they&rsquo;ve been told this in advance!</p>

<p>Having social anxiety, this isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world for me, but it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to get better at. RC will be full of fascinating people with skills I don&rsquo;t have, and sharpening my programming and interpersonal skills by learning from those folks &ndash; as well as imparting what knowledge I can &ndash; is the primary reason I applied in the first place!</p>

<p>So, note to self: when you&rsquo;re thinking that it&rsquo;s easier to just spend a few hours by yourself, remember this and try to fit in some pairing time.</p>

<p><em>How will I measure this</em>: in the 12 weeks I was at RC, did I pair at least 36 times (3x/week)? Have I made connections &ndash; new friends, colleagues, etc. &ndash; that I&rsquo;ll stick with after RC is over?</p>

<h3 id="build-something-cool-to-show-off">Build something cool to show off</h3>

<p>One possible idea I had for this is to try to resurrect My Favorite Weather Site of All Time, the late lamented WeatherSpark. The site was the best presentation of weather data I&rsquo;d ever seen, but it died an ignoble death thanks to being written entirely in Flash. Take a look &ndash; how awesome is this?</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2017/8/13/weatherspark-screen-capture.jpg" alt="weatherspark-screen-capture.jpg" /></p>

<p><em>How will I measure this</em>: did I produce at least one complete project? Was I happy with it?</p>

<h3 id="renew-and-continue-building-my-programming-and-systems-skills">Renew and continue building my programming and systems skills</h3>

<p>The job I just left was educational in many ways, but it didn&rsquo;t leave much time for nose-to-the-grindstone programming. I&rsquo;d like to get back into systems development as well as work on some new skills. These might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new language: Rust, Clojure, Ruby</li>
<li>Refamiliarizing myself with a known language: Lisp, Scheme, C/C++, Javascript</li>
<li>A new problem domain: machine learning, graphics, native applications, compilers</li>
<li>Deep dives into security</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How will I measure this</em>: can I point to at least one concrete thing a week that I didn&rsquo;t know before?</p>

<h3 id="share-my-knowledge-with-others">Share my knowledge with others</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve acquired a reasonable amount of hard-won security knowledge in my time at Akamai, some of which is likely to be of interest to other folks. I&rsquo;ve also had a good amount of experience interviewing people &ndash; perhaps I can help others to interview?</p>

<p><em>How will I measure this</em>: are there people who can say I&rsquo;ve helped them?</p>

<h3 id="make-more-public-contributions">Make more public contributions</h3>

<p>These might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>blog posts</li>
<li>programming-related tweets</li>
<li>talks</li>
<li>conference applications</li>
</ul>

<p><em>How will I measure this</em>: did I make at least one significant public contribution per week?</p>

<h3 id="embrace-serendipity">Embrace serendipity</h3>

<p>RC will certainly involve challenges and new domains I&rsquo;d never expected.</p>

<p><em>How will I measure this</em>: did I take advantage of opportunities that came my way? Did I display adaptability in the face of new challenges?</p>

<h2 id="and-so-it-begins">And so it begins</h2>

<p>Come back in 12 weeks to see how I did :)</p>
