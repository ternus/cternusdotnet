Last week was my last official day at Akamai after five years there in the wonderful InfoSec department. On Monday I start a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) (RC).

To mark the occasion, I'm jump-starting a new blog.

### Topics that may end up here

* Lessons learned, programming or otherwise
* My time at RC
* Interviewing and job hunting
* Systems and system architecture
* Security topics
* Human factors: kindness, empathy, and the people side of programming
* Other stuff I'm curious about

### Why blogging?

I've fallen out of practice writing down stuff I learn; starting RC will let me turn over a new leaf. I've also found inspiration in some other Recursers' blogs, including [Julia Evans'](https://jvns.ca) and [Dan Luu's](https://danluu.com/).
